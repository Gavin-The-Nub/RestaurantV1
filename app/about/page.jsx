          <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Savor was founded in 2010 by Chef Maria Rodriguez with a simple
            mission: to create a restaurant that celebrates the bounty of local
            ingredients while providing an exceptional dining experience.

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            What started as a small bistro has grown into a beloved culinary
            destination, but our commitment to quality, creativity, and
            hospitality remains unchanged.

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              At Savor, we believe that exceptional food starts with exceptional
              ingredients. We work closely with local farmers, fishermen, and
              producers to source the finest seasonal ingredients.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond our menu to every
              aspect of our operation, from energy-efficient kitchen equipment
              to our comprehensive recycling and composting program.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Most importantly, we believe that dining is about more than just
              foodâ€”it's about creating memorable experiences and bringing people
              together around the table.

          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We're proud to be an active member of our community. Through our
              partnerships with local schools and non-profit organizations, we
              work to promote culinary education and food security.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Our annual fundraising dinner has raised over $100,000 for local
              food banks, and our apprenticeship program provides valuable
              training and experience for aspiring chefs.
